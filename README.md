# V3

A network optimization tool designed to improve gaming performance for players with poor network conditions.

## Overview

V3 is a utility that optimizes network performance by modifying system registry settings. It reduces latency and improves responsiveness across multiple games and applications that depend on ping performance.

## How Does It Work?

V3 works by editing system registries to optimize network parameters, resulting in:
- Reduced latency
- Improved packet handling
- Better responsiveness in networked applications

## Compatibility

**Not just for Roblox!** While optimized for Roblox, V3 affects network performance for any game or application that relies on ping, including:
- Online multiplayer games
- Streaming applications
- Any network-dependent software
